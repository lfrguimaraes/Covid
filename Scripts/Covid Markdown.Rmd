## R Markdown Summary

**COVID Project**

This is an R Markdown document for COVID project.

The data source is: [Link](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19/)

```{r}
summary(parisCases) 
```








## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
